# TaskTimer: rewarding pomodoro timer app
TaskTimer is a pomodoro timer desktop application that aims to increase user’s productivity by providing them with rewards for working and studying.

## Usage instructions 

When launched, the app will open on the timer page that functions as a pomodoro timer. Users may use the timer to time their work and breaks by navigating between the “study”, “long break”, and “short break” options. The lengths of each timer option can be changed in the settings menu, which may be accessed from the menu or gear icon in the upper right. Users may also toggle sound effects on and off, and choose whether or not they want to timer to automatically switch to the next pomodoro state once a session is finished (ex: automatically start break timer after work timer ends).

The number next to the coin icon in the upper right corner represents the amount of coins the user currently has. Coins can be earned from the Tasks page, which can be accessed from the menu. Here, users can view their current challenges and collect rewards when they’re complete. If unsatisfied with the current set of challenges, users may refresh the selection by clicking the button at the top of the tasks window.

Coins may be spent on the shop page, which can also be accessed through the menu. Here, users may spend their coins to purchase new background themes for the timer. There are currently 4 purchasable backgrounds, with plans for more items to be added to the shop in the future.

The help window accessed from the question mark icon in the top right gives a brief introduction to the application and description of its usage.

## Installation instructions

Download the installer (named TaskTimer-#.#.#_Installer) in the repository, then click it to install the app on your computer. The app should now be accessible by searching on the taskbar. Currently, only windows 64-bit installation option is provided with plans for more to be added in the future. The app can be uninstalled by navigating to the apps and features section of windows settings and selecting uninstall. 

## Development history 

Creating TaskTimer was my first foray into front-end/webapp development and was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and electron. I completed the project over the course of the summer of 2025, working at a steady pace while becoming familiar with new programming languages, frameworks and technologies.

After learning the basics while developing the timer page, I was able to apply my object oriented design knowledge to the shop and tasks pages to allow for more abstraction, which will help to streamline future updates of the app.
